### License Implications and Legal Concerns

#### Apache 2.0

As the Licensees, we are distributing these libraries (without modifications)
to Amazon, by using their web services. Our work is also a Derivative of the
works, and we are also distributing it to Amazon. Additionally, subset of our
work (the fornt-end code) is also distributed in source form to our users.

Under the terms of this Apache License, this is allowed as long as we include
a notice along with our work. This notice must include a copy of the License
as well as copyright notices of the authors of the Works we use.

On the other hand, we are not allowed to use the names (or logos) of the
authors of the Works (but we may use them to make the notice).

Finally, we may not hold liable the authors of the Works we use for any
problem we might encounter.

Overall, aside from the obligations we must fulfill in producing the notice,
being subject to this License should not pose any legal risks with regard to
our work.
