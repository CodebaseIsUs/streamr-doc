### License Implications and Legal Concerns

As the Licensees, we are distributing these libraries (without modifications)
to Amazon, by using their web services. Our work is also a Derivative of the
works, and we are also distributing it to Amazon. Additionally, subset of our
work (the fornt-end code) is also distributed in source form to our users.

#### Apache 2.0

Under the terms of this Apache License, we are allowed this distribution as
long as we include
a notice along with our work. This notice must include a copy of the License
as well as copyright notices of the authors of the Works we use.

On the other hand, we are not allowed to use the names (or logos) of the
authors of the Works (but we may use them to make the notice).

Finally, we may not hold liable the authors of the Works we use for any
problem we might encounter.

Overall, aside from the obligations we must fulfill in producing the notice,
being subject to this License should not pose any legal risks with regard to
our work.

#### MIT

Similarly to being subject to the Apache v2 License, we may distribute our
derived work (and copies of `java-jwk`, the work we use that has this
license) as long as we include Auth0's copyright notice as well as a copy of
the license.

We may use Auth0's trademarks or logos too, but we may not hold them liable
for any issues we might encounter.

Aside from the obligation of including the copyright and the License, being
subject to this License should not pose any legar risks with regard to our
work.

#### GNU Public License v3
