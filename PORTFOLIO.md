## Audience

According to
[twitch trends](https://twitchtracker.com/games/26936)
there has been a big rise in the nubmer of viewers of live music streams on
the platform Twitch. On Twitch, this category is predominantly DJ stream
which is very relevant for our project. Upon further research, these trends
also apply to other streaming platforms such as Youtube Live.
<br /> <br />
For these reasons, we think that our product will be of huge benefit for
music listeners online.
<br />
Researching this stakeholder has directly affected our product. We decided
that the listeners side should be as seamless as possible using platforms
such as Twitch and Youtube. Therefore, we integrated our product such that
the DJs can simply just copy and paste their stream key from their streaming
platform of choice and the audience can seamlessly listen to the performance without even seeing our product directly.

## DJs

This stakeholder is a direct user of our product as they will be the only one
that's using the user interface. We initially researched around the internet
to get an idea of useful our product would be for this stake holder. We later
asked on reddit [How popular would a webapp to enable online b2b
be?](https://www.reddit.com/r/DJs/comments/gmlpf1/how_popular_would_a_webapp_to_enable_online_b2b_be/)
and got an overwhelming positive response that told us that this idea would
be of great benefit for this stakeholder. Our product will allow DJs to
collaborate in a way that wasn't before and therefore opening up more
creative possibilities.

## Record Labels

Another stakeholder in our product would be the record labels. Although this
stakeholder is almost completely indirect as they wouldn't be using the
product themselves, it can still provide a great benefit for them.
Collaboration in music is one of the best ways to attract and grow audiances
as the following of both artists can be mutually shared. We have reached out
to a few record labels and they were very interested in our product as they
want to keep up with the tends and be able to use new opportunities.

# Current/Future state

## Opportunity statement

## Testing and validation

We did weekly interviews with DJs.

Their feedback changed how we developed our user experience. For example:

DJ Tristan:

> Maybe have two sets of faders [...] then I could listen two both tracks at the same, but not the audience.

And so we developed separate cure faders, going from design A to design B. **TODO designs here**

Additional examples includea adding an 'uploaded song list' or showing interactive feedback of a fellow DJ's actinos.

## Impact of DJStreamr

As shown so far, positive feedback and reactions from a wide range of stakeholders is overwhelming.

- DJ Tristan:

  > I am surprised at how usable it is. This could really be a thing.
