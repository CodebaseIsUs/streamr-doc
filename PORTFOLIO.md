# Current/Future state

## Opportunity statement

## Testing and validation

We did weekly interviews with DJs.

Their feedback changed how we developed our user experience. For example:

DJ Tristan:
> Maybe have two sets of faders [...] then I could listen two both tracks at the same, but not the audience.

And so we developed separate cure faders, going from design A to design B. **TODO designs here**

Additional examples includea adding an 'uploaded song list' or showing interactive feedback of a fellow DJ's actinos.

## Impact of DJStreamr
As shown so far, positive feedback and reactions from a wide range of stakeholders is overwhelming.

- DJ Tristan:
  > I am surprised at how usable it is. This could really be a thing.
