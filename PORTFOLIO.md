## Audience

According to
[twitch trends](https://twitchtracker.com/games/26936)
there has been a big rise in the nubmer of viewers of live music streams on
the platform Twitch. On Twitch, this category is predominantly DJ stream
which is very relevant for our project. Upon further research, these trends
also apply to other streaming platforms such as Youtube Live.
<br /> <br />
For these reasons, we think that our product will be of huge benefit for
music listeners online.
<br />
Researching this stakeholder has directly affected our product. We decided
that the listeners side should be as seamless as possible using platforms
such as Twitch and Youtube. Therefore, we integrated our product such that
the DJs can simply just copy and paste their stream key from their streaming
platform of choice and the audience can seamlessly listen to the performance without even seeing our product directly.
